# AraDictImproved

A program to deconstruct an arabic word and return its possible defintions using an updated and hopefully improved version of aramorph which can be found [here](https://github.com/gitGNU/gnu_aramorph).

Aramorph was used as the basis for the website [Aratools](http://www.aratools.com/) which I found absolutely vital at university!

The original database has been updated so that words no longer need to be transliterated before checking them. This is because the entire database has itself been transliterated into arabic, hopefully improving the performance of the program.

This program is currently running as an api on my website, which I intend to use as the backend for other projects.
