# AraDictImproved

A program to deconstruct an arabic word and return its possible defintions using an updated and hopefully improved version of aramorph.

Aramorph was used as the basis for the website [Aratools](http://www.aratools.com/) which I found absolutely vital at university!

My intention is to be able to deploy this program as an api to use in other projects.

I'd eventually like to alter the database so that transliteration is no longer necessary. Might do that in the future...
